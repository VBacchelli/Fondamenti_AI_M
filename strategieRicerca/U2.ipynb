However, in order to correctly use the Graph-search algorithms, the `__eq__()` method should be overrided correctly. *Suggestion: in the first exercise, opt to represent the state using a tuple. The `__eq__()` method iis already properly overridden, so it would be an easy way for starting with.*\n",
